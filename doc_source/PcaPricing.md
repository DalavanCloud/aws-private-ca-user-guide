You are charged for private certificates whose private key you can access\. This includes certificates that you export from ACM and certificates that you create from the ACM PCA API or ACM PCA CLI\. You are not charged for a private certificate after it has been [deleted](PCADeleteCA.md)\. However, if you [restore](PCARestoreCA.md) a private CA, you are charged for the time between deletion and restoration\. Private certificates whose private key you cannot access are free\. These include certificates that are used with [Integrated Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-services.html) such as Elastic Load Balancing, CloudFront, and API Gateway\.
