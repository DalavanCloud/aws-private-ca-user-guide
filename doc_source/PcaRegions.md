Like most AWS resources, private certificate authorities \(CAs\) are regional resources\. To use private CAs in more than one region, you must create your CAs in those regions\. You cannot copy private CAs between regions\. Visit [AWS Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#acm-pca_region) in the *AWS General Reference* or the [AWS Region Table](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) to see the regional availability for ACM PCA\. 

**Note**  
ACM is currently available in some regions that ACM PCA is not\.
