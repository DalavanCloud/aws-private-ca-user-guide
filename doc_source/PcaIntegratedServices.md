# Services Integrated with AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority<a name="PcaIntegratedServices"></a>

If you use ACM to request a private certificate, you can associate the certificate with any of the services that are integrated with ACM with the exception of AWS CloudFormation\. For more information, see [Integrated Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-services.html)\. If you use the ACM PCA API or AWS CLI to issue a certificate or if you export a private certificate from ACM, you can install the certificate anywhere you want\.
